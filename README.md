![filters](images/filters_1.png)

**Filter Panel Overview**

The filter panel allows users to refine playback data by platform (e.g., Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, web player, or cast devices), as well as playback behavior such as whether tracks were **shuffled** or **skipped**. This enables targeted insights based on listening context and device usage patterns.

## üìä **Dashboard 2: Listening Behavior Analysis**

![dashboard-2](images/2-listening_hours.png)

This dashboard provides two key insights into listening habits:

* **Listening Hours vs Days**: A heatmap displaying listening activity distributed across each hour of the day and day of the week. The darker the shade, the higher the listening frequency, offering a clear view of peak listening periods. Notably, late-night and early morning hours show the highest engagement, with Sundays and Mondays being particularly active.

* **Average Listening Time vs Track Frequency**: An interactive scatter plot allowing users to explore track engagement patterns. Tracks are plotted by how often they are played (frequency) against their average listening time (in minutes).

  * **Sliders** enable dynamic filtering by minimum listening time and frequency, helping identify the most consistently played and attentively listened-to tracks (highlighted in green).

Together, these visualizations offer a granular view of when and how content is consumed, supporting deeper behavioral analysis and content strategy optimization.

## üìä Dashboard Page - 3 : Details
